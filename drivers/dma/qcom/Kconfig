	  Enable support for the Qualcomm Technologies HIDMA Management.
	  Each DMA device requires one management interface driver
	  for basic initialization before QCOM_HIDMA channel driver can
	  start managing the channels. In a virtualized environment,
	  the guest OS would run QCOM_HIDMA channel driver and the
	  host would run the QCOM_HIDMA_MGMT management driver.

	  Enable support for the Qualcomm Technologies HIDMA controller.
	  The HIDMA controller supports optimized buffer copies
	  (user to kernel, kernel to kernel, etc.).  It only supports
	  memcpy interface. The core is not intended for general
	  purpose slave DMA.

	  The SPS (Smart Peripheral Switch) is a DMA engine.
	  It can move data in the following modes:
		1. Peripheral-to-Peripheral.
		2. Peripheral-to-Memory.
		3. Memory-to-Memory.

	  The BAM-DMA is used for Memory-to-Memory transfers.
	  The main use cases is RPC between processors.
	  The BAM-DMA hardware has 2 registers sets:
	  1. A BAM HW like all the peripherals.
	  2. A DMA channel configuration (i.e. channel priority).
